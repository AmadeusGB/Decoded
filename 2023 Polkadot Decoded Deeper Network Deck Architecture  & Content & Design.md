    - The Significance of Decentralization

*Content and Speaker's Note:*

"Let's take a journey through the evolution of the internet. In the early days, we had Web1.0, which was a static web. It was like a library where you could read, but not interact. Then came Web2.0, the social web. It’s dynamic, with user-generated content, and it’s where social media thrived.

Now, we are entering the era of Web3.0 - the decentralized web. Imagine a web where you don’t just interact but have a stake. A web where you control your data, where applications are decentralized, and where blockchain technology is fundamental.

Web3 is about taking back control. It’s about decentralized applications, smart contracts, and true ownership of data. It’s an evolution that is as significant as when we went from the static web to the social web."

*Design Layout:*

1. The top section of the slide should have the title and subtitle centered.

*Content and Speaker's Note:*

"Let’s now delve into one of the most innovative aspects of Deeper Network, the Decentralized Edge Computing Platform, or DEP. DEP is an off-chain infrastructure built on Deeper device nodes. It is designed to release decentralized tasks, monitor specific events, analyze these events, and trigger specific task workflows.

DEP is a game-changer for Web3. It integrates blockchain, cybersecurity, and sharing economy to create a decentralized platform that opens up new possibilities for applications including predictors, zero net, lightning network, triggers, mail services, and more.

One of the most exciting real-world applications of DEP is in the Web3 scenario - Oracle. Traditional oracles are centralized and have security risks. DEP revolutionizes this by processing oracle tasks in a much more secure manner. The nodes executing an oracle are randomly chosen, and most are hidden on the Intranet, making it difficult for hackers to attack. Even if they find a Deeper device, they have to pass through Deeper’s 7-layer firewall and triple-layer file encryption system.

DEP is not just technology; it’s a catalyst for change. It’s about creating a more secure, efficient, and decentralized Web3 that empowers users and communities."

"In the Web3 ecosystem, security and privacy are paramount. As we transition to a decentralized web, the stakes are higher than ever. We must protect not just our data but our digital identities and assets.

Deeper Network takes this responsibility seriously. We are the guardians of the web. Our security measures include a Layer 7 enterprise-grade firewall that secures the entire network. It blocks ads and trackers, monitors web traffic, and filters content on all internet devices.

But security is not just about protection; it’s about empowerment. Privacy is a fundamental right. Deeper Network ensures user privacy through Decentralized Private Networks (DPN), which are serverless and distributed. This ensures that user data can never be logged, leaked, hacked, or subpoenaed.

Our Trident Protocol is a decentralized, shared communications protocol based on blockchain technology. It uses adaptive tunneling and intelligent routing technologies to provide in-depth security protection and an improved user experience.

Let me share a real-world scenario. Imagine a journalist in a region with heavy internet censorship and surveillance. Using Deeper Network’s DPN, the journalist can securely and privately access and share information without fear of reprisal. This is the power of security and privacy in Web3."

We actively engage with our community through various channels, including social media, forums, and events. Our community members are not just users; they are contributors, advocates, and stakeholders in our mission.

One of the ways we empower our community is through our referendum governance mechanism. Any DPR holder can propose changes, and the community votes on these proposals. This ensures that our network evolves according to the needs and desires of the community.

Let me share a success story that exemplifies the power of community. Through community feedback, we developed a parental control function in our Deeper Connect devices. This feature allows families to filter harmful information on the Internet. This was a direct result of our community’s input and has become one of our most praised features.
