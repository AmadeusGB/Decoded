    - Global sharing economy size: $335 billion (2025)
- Quote: "The intersection of Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and the Sharing Economy is where the future is being built." - Anonymous

*Content and Speaker's Note:*

"As we delve into the Web3 ecosystem, it is essential to understand the three quintessential pillars that support this transformation: Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and the Sharing Economy. These are not isolated technologies; rather, they synergize to create a resilient and secure ecosystem for the decentralized web.

Blockchain is the backbone, providing a decentralized ledger and smart contracts that enable trustless transactions and ownership.

Cybersecurity ensures the integrity and security of data and transactions. In an era where data breaches and cyber threats are rampant, cybersecurity is not an option; it’s a necessity.

The Sharing Economy is about utilizing resources efficiently. It’s about creating value by sharing - whether it’s sharing computing power, data, or network bandwidth.

Together, these three pillars form a triad that is greater than the sum of its parts. They enable new business models, empower individuals, and pave the way for innovations that were unimaginable in the Web2 era."

*Design Layout:*

1. The slide background should be sleek and modern, possibly with a subtle technological pattern or gradient.
2. The title and subtitle should be at the top, centered, in bold fonts.
3. Below the title, place a large Venn Diagram with three overlapping circles. Each circle represents one of the elements: Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Sharing Economy.
4. Inside each circle, include an icon representing the element (e.g., chain link for Blockchain, shield for Cybersecurity, and people for Sharing Economy) along with 2-3 keywords (e.g., Transparency, Security, Decentralization).
5. In the intersection of the circles, include an icon representing synergy or transformation.
6. On the right or bottom of the Venn Diagram, include a section with eye-catching statistics in the form of infographics.

3. The statistics section should be visually engaging, with infographics that are easy to understand at a glance.
4. The quote should be in a contrasting color to stand out.
5. The speaker should use a laser pointer or similar tool to guide the audience through the elements of the Venn Diagram.
6. The transition to this slide should be dynamic, possibly with the circles of the Venn Diagram appearing one after the other.critical and how they are interwoven in the fabric of Web3.

*Additional Information:*

The statistics section will include the following data in a visually engaging format:

- Blockchain: "Global blockchain market size is expected to reach $30 billion by 2023."
- Cybersecurity: "By 2025, the financial impact of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually."
- Sharing Economy: "The global sharing economy is expected to grow to approximately $335 billion by 2025."

These statistics will be presented using infographics. For instance, the blockchain statistic could be represented by a rising graph with a chain link pattern, the cybersecurity statistic could be represented by a shield with a dollar sign, and the sharing economy statistic could be represented by a pie chart with people icons.

The quote, "The intersection of Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and the Sharing Economy is where the future is being built," should be prominently displayed at the bottom in an elegant font. This quote serves to emphasize the importance and interplay of these three transformative technologies.

The speaker should engage with the audience by asking if anyone has experienced the impact of these technologies in their own lives and should be prepared to give real-world examples of how this triad is currently transforming various industries.

In terms of design precautions, it’s important to ensure that the slide is not too cluttered and that each element has enough space. The fonts should be legible even for those sitting further back in the audience. The color scheme should be consistent with the branding of the company or topic and should be visually appealing without being distracting.

In summary, this slide serves as a visually engaging and informative overview of the interplay between Blockchain, Cybersecurity, and the Sharing Economy, highlighting their collective impact and significance in the modern world.

*Content and Speaker's Note:*

"Let’s now delve into one of the most innovative aspects of Deeper Network, the Decentralized Edge Computing Platform, or DEP. DEP is an off-chain infrastructure built on Deeper device nodes. It is designed to release decentralized tasks, monitor specific events, analyze these events, and trigger specific task workflows.

DEP is a game-changer for Web3. It integrates blockchain, cybersecurity, and sharing economy to create a decentralized platform that opens up new possibilities for applications including predictors, zero net, lightning network, triggers, mail services, and more.

One of the most exciting real-world applications of DEP is in the Web3 scenario - Oracle. Traditional oracles are centralized and have security risks. DEP revolutionizes this by processing oracle tasks in a much more secure manner. The nodes executing an oracle are randomly chosen, and most are hidden on the Intranet, making it difficult for hackers to attack. Even if they find a Deeper device, they have to pass through Deeper’s 7-layer firewall and triple-layer file encryption system.

DEP is not just technology; it’s a catalyst for change. It’s about creating a more secure, efficient, and decentralized Web3 that empowers users and communities."
